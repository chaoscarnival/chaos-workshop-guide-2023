  **Note**: Note the Account ID (underlined in red in the above screenshot). This will be needed while submitting request for the sandbox environment.
  
- You will see a modal asking to to "Enable Chaos Infrastructure To Run Your First Chaos Experiment". At this point, pause action on the Harness UI & proceed with the next step to obtain the sandbox environment.

### Obtain a Sandbox Environment to Run Chaos Experiments 

- Fill up and submit this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgLSi2W8LystCMSTP3SICSHfI8jADieU3Pbp-ZMvhhhSS0Fw/viewform) to request a timed (6 hours) sandbox environment to carry out the chaos workshop steps 

- In under 2 minutes, check your email and verify receipt of your sandbox config information, which consits of: 
  - A KubeConfig file, which you can download and use as the context for navigating the namespace provided 
    - **Note**: You will need `kubectl` setup in your local workspace to view the resources in your sandbox environment
  - URLs to a sample microservices application (which will be subjected to chaos during the workshop), the grafana dashboard where it is monitored along    with the corresponding prometheus endpoint.
  
## Setup The Chaos Infrastructure 

- Now, proceed with setting up of the chaos infrastructure on the "default project". You can create a dedicated/new project if you wish. 
- You will be needed to create a new "Environment", download the installation manifest for the  chaos infra and apply it the provided sandbox environment. The detailed set of steps to achieve this can be found here: https://developer.harness.io/docs/chaos-engineering/user-guides/connect-chaos-infrastructures

**Note**: Please select the "Namespace Mode" option for chaos infrastructure. Selection of "Cluster Wide" option can result in failure/is unsupported for this workshop. 

## Connect The Custom ChaosHub

- The project is already configured with the "Enterprise ChaosHub" which consists of all the supported faults. However, to simplify things, we have a
  dedicated/custom chaos artifact source for this workshop. 
- Add a new chaoshub by following the steps outlined here: https://developer.harness.io/docs/chaos-engineering/user-guides/add-chaos-hub. Use the github   repo URL https://github.com/chaoscarnival/hub-workshop-2023
- Browse the newly added chaoshub. You will see 4 chaos experiments ready to be launched.
